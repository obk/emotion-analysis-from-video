# emotion analysis on videos

this python script performs emotion analysis on videos using deep learning models. it leverages opencv for face detection and deepface for emotion recognition. the script is designed to be efficient by parallelizing the processing of video frames.

## features

- **hybrid face detection**: combines opencv's haar cascades with deepface to improve accuracy.
- **parallel processing**: utilizes `threadpoolexecutor` to process multiple frames in parallel, reducing overall execution time.
- **efficient data structures**: uses futures to handle asynchronous results efficiently.
- **temporal smoothing**: smooths emotion predictions over a temporal window for better reliability.

## prerequisites

before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless deepface pandas
```

## how to run

1. save the script as `app.py`.
2. open a terminal or command prompt.
3. navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located.
4. run the script with the path to your video file:

```bash
python app.py <video_path>
```

replace `<video_path>` with the actual path to your video file.

## example

if you have a video file named `example.mp4`, you would run:

```bash
python app.py example.mp4
```

the script will output the dominant emotion detected in each second of the video.

### additional notes

- **video path**: the script expects a single argument, which is the path to the video file. if you have multiple videos, you'll need to run the script separately for each one.
- **resource management**: the script uses `threadpoolexecutor` with a limited number of workers (4 by default). adjust this based on your system's capabilities and resource usage.
